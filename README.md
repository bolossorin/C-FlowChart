# Description
FlowchartToCode is a free C# application that helps you create programs using simple flowcharts.
Typically, programs are written using a text editor. Depending on the programming language, this can be either easy or quite difficult for a beginning programmer. Many languages require you to write lines upon lines of confusing code just to get it to display "Hello, world!".
However, using FlowchartToCode, you can use shapes to represent the different actions that you want your program to perform. So, you can concentrate on the algorithm rather than all the nuances and details of a typical programming language.
You can execute your programs directly in FlowchartToCode. But, if you want to learn a high-level programming language, FlowchartToCode can convert your flowchart to many popular languages. These include: C# and C++ for Applications.
### What are program Flowcharts 
These are used by programmers. A program flowchart shows the program structure, logic flow and operations performed. It also forms an important part of the documentation of the system. It broadly includes the following:
- Program Structure.
- Program Logic.
- Data Inputs at various stages.
- Data Processing
- Computations and Calculations.
- Conditions on which decisions are based.
- Branching & Looping Sequences.
- Results.
- Various Outputs.
## Shapes
### Assignment Shape
 The Assignment shape is used to store the result of a calculation into a variable. This is one of the most common tasks found in programs.
### Declare Shape
 A Declare Statement is used to create variables and arrays. These are used to store data while the program runs.
### For Shape
 For Loops increment a variable through a range of values. This is a common, useful, replacement for a While Statement.
### If Shape
 An If Statement checks a Boolean expression and then executes a true or false branch based on the result.
### Input Shape
 An Input Statement reads a value from the keyboard and stores the result in a variable.
### Output Shape
 An Output Statement evaluates an expression and then displays the result on the screen.
### While Shape
A While Loop evaluates a Boolean expression and, if true, executes statements. It rechecks the expression and loops until it is false.
